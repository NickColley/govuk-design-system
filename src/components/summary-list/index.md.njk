Use the summary list to summarise information, for example, a user’s responses at the end of a form.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

## When to use this component

Use the summary list component to present pairs of related information, known as key-value pairs, in a list. The key is a description or label of a piece of information, like ‘Name’, and the value is the piece of information itself, like ‘John Smith’.

You can use it to display metadata like ‘Last updated’ with a date like ‘22 June 2018’, or to summarise a user’s responses at the end of a form like the [check answers](/patterns/check-answers/) pattern.

## When not to use this component

The summary list uses the description list (`<dl>`) HTML element, so only use it to present information that has a key and at least one value.

Do not use it for tabular data or a simple list of information or tasks, like a [task list](/patterns/task-list-pages/). For those use a `<table>`, `<ul>` or `<ol>`.

## How it works

You can show a single or multiple summary lists on a page.

To add structure to a page with multiple summary lists, you can use headings or summary cards.

There are 2 ways to use the summary list component. You can use HTML or, if you’re using [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) or the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com), you can use the Nunjucks macro.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "without-actions", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

###  Adding actions to each row

You can add actions to a summary list, like a ‘Change’ link to let users go back and edit their answer.

For sighted users, the actions get their context from the other content in the row they appear in.

Assistive technology users, like those who use a screen reader, may hear the links out of context and not know what they do.

To give more context, add visually hidden text to the links. This means a screen reader user will hear a meaningful action, like ‘Change name’ or ‘Change date of birth’.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "default", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false, titleSuffix: "second"}) }}

If you have a mix of rows with and without actions, add the `govuk-summary-list__row--no-actions` modifier class to the rows without actions.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "mixed-actions", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Removing the borders

The summary list includes some separating borders to help users read each row and its action.

If your summary list does not have any actions, you can choose to remove the separating borders with the `govuk-summary-list--no-border` class.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "without-borders", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

To remove borders on a single row, use the `govuk-summary-list__row--no-border` class.

## Showing multiple summary lists

If you’re showing multiple summary lists on the same page, you can wrap each list into a summary card. This lets you visually separate them and give each list a title and some actions.

Use summary cards when you need to:
* show multiple summary lists that are related to one another
* show actions that will apply to everything in a summary list

If you’re showing summary cards at the end of a journey, you might want to familiarise the user with them earlier on — such as when the user reviews individual sections.

Do not use summary cards if you only need to show a small amount of related information. Use summary lists instead, and structure them with headings if needed.

### Summary card with a title

Use the summary card’s header to give each summary list a title.

Each title should be unique and help identify what the summarised information is about. For example, this could be the name of an organisation or a professional qualification.

A title can simply be one or two of the important values in the summary list. Try to keep titles short.

{{ example({group: "components", item: "summary-list", example: "card-with-title", html: true, nunjucks: true, open: false}) }}

### Summary card with a title and actions

Show any summary card actions in the header. 

These links should let the user affect all values in the summary card, such as ‘Delete’, ‘Edit’ or ‘Update status’. 

For example, you might choose to show a single ‘Change’ link in the header instead of repeating ‘Change’ links for every value that would go to the same place.

Do not add more than 3 actions in a header.

Remember to follow all other guidance for adding actions in ‘Adding actions to each row’.

[EXAMPLE]

### Summary card without a title

Summary cards should include a title — but there are some cases when you might choose to use a summary card without a title.

For example, you might need to show multiple summary lists when it does not make sense to write titles or headings for them, but need to visually separate them.

Similarly, you might need to show one or more summary lists that do not call for titles together with summary cards that do, and need them to look consistent.

## Research on this component

This component was developed and tested by the Government Digital Services as part of the [check answers pattern](/patterns/check-answers/).

### Next steps

More research is needed to find out how well this component works outside the check answers pattern, for example, to present summaries within caseworking systems.
